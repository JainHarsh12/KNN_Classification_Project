# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification Project

This project demonstrates binary classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The goal is to predict labels based on sample features using optimal `k`.

## Project Structure

- `knn_classification.py`: Contains code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and visualization.
- `README.md`: Instructions and documentation for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Required packages for setup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
